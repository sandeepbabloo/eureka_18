Each entry will be judged by multiple judges and the final scores will be normalised by proven and genuine statistical methods. Questionnaires will be judged on the basis of the following criteria and each criterion would be marked on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the highest and 1 being the lowest. 

                        					Criterion 1 : What is MVP ?
                        					Minimum viable product (MVP) is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.
                       						 Please refer to Minimum Viable Product for additional Information. 

                       						 Criterion 2 :Is it compulsory for everyone to make the MVP to be considered as a participant ?
                        					 MVP has been introduced for the semifinalist stage. It has been introduced only to provide impetus to those who would like a tangible product to help them in market analysis

                        					Criterion 3 :How important is MVP? Is it a part of the judging criteria?
                        					MVP will be judged explicitly during the semi-final and final pitching round of Eureka! 2018.

                        					What are the ways we would be helped to make an MVP?
                        					You will be provided with ample resources to help you through. Given that, you can always consult your allotted mentor regarding the same.
